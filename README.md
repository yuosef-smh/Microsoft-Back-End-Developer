# ASP.NET Core Minimal API with Middleware

This project demonstrates an ASP.NET Core Minimal API with custom middleware for global error handling, authentication, and logging.

## Features

- **Global Error Handling**: Middleware to handle exceptions and return appropriate error responses.
- **Authentication**: Middleware to validate JWT tokens and restrict access to authenticated users.
- **Logging**: Middleware to log HTTP requests and responses.

# Generation, Debugging, and Optimization
- This project was generated, debugged, and optimized with the assistance of Microsoft Copilot. Copilot helped ensure the code is efficient, handles errors globally, implements authentication, and includes comprehensive logging.

# Important Note
- Only modified files are added to the repository for security purposes to not expose sensitive information by mistake. The other files has been generated by running **dotnet new webapi -o UserManagementAPI**
